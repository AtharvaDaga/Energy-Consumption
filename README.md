# Energy Consumption
**Energy Consumption Prediction System**

📌 **Project Overview**

- An end-to-end Machine Learning system that predicts household energy consumption using Multiple Linear Regression. The model is deployed via a Flask REST API and integrated with a Flutter mobile application, enabling users to get real-time energy consumption predictions based on building and environmental inputs.

🎯 **Objective**

- Build an ML model to predict energy consumption accurately
- Deploy the model using a Flask API for real-time predictions
- Integrate ML backend with a Flutter mobile app
- Provide a practical solution for smart energy forecasting

🛠️ **Tech Stack**

- ML: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
- Backend: Flask, REST API
- Mobile App: Flutter, Dart
- Deployment: Render, GitHub

✨ **Key Highlights**

- Developed Multiple Linear Regression prediction model
- Performed data preprocessing, encoding, and normalization
- Evaluated model using MAE, RMSE, and R² metrics
- Built and deployed Flask REST API for real-time inference
- Integrated ML model with Flutter mobile application
- Deployed complete system on cloud for accessibility

📊 **Output**
- Snapshot Energy prediction
